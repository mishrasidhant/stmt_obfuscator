# PDF Export Functionality Enhancements

## Description

This PR implements several key enhancements to the PDF export functionality, significantly improving the quality, reliability, and user experience of the exported PDFs. The implemented features include advanced layout preservation, intelligent text wrapping, font fallback mechanisms, and improved preview accuracy.

## Implementation Details

### Advanced Layout Preservation (PE-01)
- Created a new `LayoutAnalyzer` class that analyzes the structure of PDF documents
- Implemented mapping between original layout elements and their obfuscated counterparts
- Enhanced the `PDFFormatter` class to use the layout analyzer for preserving the original document's layout
- Added support for different text alignments (left, center, right)
- Implemented identification of potential headers and footers
- Added graceful fallback to standard formatting when layout preservation is not possible

### Text Wrapping with Margin Awareness (PE-02)
- Implemented a `wrap_text` method that calculates available width and breaks text into lines
- Added special handling for very long words that exceed the available width
- Implemented proper paragraph preservation with empty line handling
- Added automatic page creation when content exceeds page height

### Font Fallback Mechanism (PE-16)
- Created a configurable font fallback chain
- Implemented character-by-character font selection based on Unicode blocks
- Added automatic font switching for mixed-script text
- Implemented caching for performance optimization
- Added comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Preview Accuracy Improvements (PE-09)
- Created a new `PDFPreviewGenerator` class that uses the same `PDFFormatter` as the export function
- Implemented support for both text and PDF preview modes in the UI
- Added configurable preview quality settings (Low, Medium, High)
- Implemented multi-page PDF preview support with proper page separation

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Added unit tests for the `LayoutAnalyzer` class
- Updated tests for the `PDFFormatter` class to test layout preservation
- Added tests for the `PDFPreviewGenerator` class
- Added tests for text wrapping and font fallback functionality
- Fixed compatibility issues with headless testing environments

### Manual Testing
- Tested with various PDF documents to ensure layout is preserved correctly
- Verified text wrapping behavior with different content types
- Tested font fallback with documents containing special characters
- Verified preview accuracy matches final output

## Documentation

- Updated `docs/running_locally.md` with information about the new PDF export features
- Updated `docs/user_guide.md` with instructions on how to use the PDF export functionality
- Created `docs/pdf_export_summary.md` that summarizes all the improvements made
- Updated the PDF export improvements document to mark completed tasks
- Added detailed comments to the code explaining the implementation approaches

## Known Limitations

- The RAG integration test has compatibility issues with NumPy 2.0 (chromadb dependency)
- Very complex tables may not maintain their exact original formatting
- Processing very large documents (>50 pages) may be slow
