# PII Detection Proof-of-Concept: Key Findings and Recommendations

## Implementation Summary

This proof-of-concept for PII detection in bank statements using Ollama with local LLMs includes:

1. A Python script for Ollama API integration and PII detection
2. Synthetic bank statement generator with ground truth annotations
3. Evaluation framework for measuring detection accuracy

## Key Findings

1. **Baseline Performance Metrics**:
   - Overall F1-Score: 0.34
   - Best Sample Precision: 0.70
   - Best Sample Recall: 0.50
   - Performance varies significantly between samples (F1-scores ranging from 0.10 to 0.58)

2. **Prompt Engineering Impact**:
   - Initial generic prompts resulted in poor performance (F1-score of 0.03)
   - Specifying exact PII entity types and format requirements improved F1-score by 10x
   - Consistent entity type naming between detection and ground truth is critical

3. **Model Behavior**:
   - The model performs better on certain PII types (names, addresses) than others
   - False positives often include non-PII text that resembles PII patterns
   - Position detection (start/end indices) is challenging for the model

4. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Ollama API integration works reliably but requires proper error handling
   - Local model inference is fast enough for practical use (few seconds per statement)
   - Model availability and versioning needs careful management

5. **Evaluation Methodology**:
   - Entity-level evaluation provides more actionable insights than token-level
   - Partial matches (overlapping text spans) should be handled appropriately
   - Separate metrics for different PII types would provide more granular insights

## Recommendations for Full Implementation

1. **PII Detection Enhancements**:
   - **Implement Two-Stage Detection**: First identify PII candidates, then validate and classify them
   - **Develop Type-Specific Prompts**: Create specialized prompts for different PII categories
   - **Add Post-Processing Rules**: Apply regex patterns to validate and standardize detected entities
   - **Consider Confidence Thresholds**: Allow adjustable confidence levels for different PII types

2. **PDF Processing Strategy**:
   - **Preserve Layout Context**: Include spatial information in prompts to improve detection
   - **Chunk Documents Strategically**: Process by logical sections rather than arbitrary text blocks
   - **Maintain Position Mapping**: Carefully track text positions between PDF and plain text

3. **RAG Implementation**:
   - **Focus on Ambiguous Cases**: Use RAG selectively for uncertain detections rather than all text
   - **Prioritize Bank-Specific Patterns**: Build knowledge base of financial institution formats
   - **Include Document Context**: Use document structure (headers, tables) to improve detection

4. **User Experience Considerations**:
   - **Implement Confidence Visualization**: Highlight detected PII with confidence indicators
   - **Enable Manual Correction**: Allow users to add/remove detected entities
   - **Provide Batch Processing Status**: Show progress and interim results for large documents

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - **Expand Test Dataset**: Create more diverse synthetic samples with varied formats
   - **Implement Cross-Validation**: Test across different statement types and banks
   - **Benchmark Multiple Models**: Compare performance across different Ollama models

## Task List Adjustments

Based on these findings, the following adjustments to the implementation tasks are recommended:

1. **Prioritize prompt engineering** in the PII Detection Core phase
2. **Add a post-processing module** for entity validation and standardization
3. **Implement confidence scoring** earlier in the development cycle
4. **Create specialized detection modules** for different PII types
5. **Develop a more sophisticated chunking strategy** for PDF processing
6. **Make RAG optional and targeted** rather than applied to all text
7. **Add user review capabilities** earlier in the UI development phase
8. **Expand the testing framework** to include type-specific performance metrics

These adjustments will help address the challenges identified in the proof-of-concept and improve the overall effectiveness of the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator.
