# PDF Parsing Module Implementation

## Task Description
Implement a PDF parsing module using PyMuPDF (fitz) that validates PDF structure, extracts text blocks with positional metadata, identifies tables and financial data sections, and creates a structured document object with layout coordinates.

## Implementation Details

### 1. PDF Structure Validation
- Implemented robust validation of PDF structure with detailed error reporting
- Checks for:
  - Valid PDF format
  - Readable content
  - Appropriate page count
  - Absence of encryption
  - Presence of text content
- Returns validation status and detailed error messages

### 2. Text Extraction with Positional Metadata
- Extracted text blocks with rich metadata:
  - Text content
  - Bounding box coordinates (x0, y0, x1, y1)
  - Font information (size, family, weight)
  - Text color
  - Line spacing
  - Character spacing
- Preserved original layout information for accurate PII detection and redaction

### 3. Table and Financial Data Detection
- Implemented algorithms to identify:
  - Tables based on layout analysis
  - Row and column structures
  - Headers and data cells
  - Financial data sections (account summaries, transaction lists)
  - Balance and amount fields
- Used heuristics and pattern recognition to distinguish tables from regular text

### 4. Structured Document Object
- Created a comprehensive document object model with:
  - Hierarchical structure (document → pages → sections → blocks → lines → spans)
  - Layout coordinates for all elements
  - Classification of content types (header, footer, body, table)
  - Relationships between elements
- Designed to facilitate both PII detection and subsequent redaction

### 5. Strategic Document Chunking
- Implemented intelligent chunking strategies:
  - Chunk by logical sections rather than arbitrary text blocks
  - Preserve context within chunks
  - Maintain section boundaries
  - Optimize chunk size for PII detection
- Ensures that PII detection has sufficient context for accurate identification

### 6. Integration with PII Detection
- Designed interfaces for seamless integration with the PII detection module
- Provided methods to:
  - Convert between PDF coordinates and text positions
  - Map detected PII back to original PDF locations
  - Retrieve context around potential PII entities
- Ensures that detected PII can be accurately located and redacted

### 7. Performance Optimization
- Implemented efficient parsing algorithms
- Added caching mechanisms for repeated operations
- Optimized memory usage for large documents
- Included progress tracking for long-running operations

## Outcome
The PDF parsing module successfully extracts text and structural information from PDF bank statements while preserving layout and positional data. The module provides a solid foundation for PII detection by ensuring that text is properly chunked and contextualized, addressing key findings from the proof-of-concept.

## Commit
The changes were committed with the message: "Implement PDF parsing module with layout preservation and table detection"

## Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed an import issue with the `Rect` class from PyMuPDF by using tuples for bounding boxes
- Improved error handling for MagicMock objects in tests
- Fixed test methodology for the `close` method
- Added documentation for troubleshooting common issues
