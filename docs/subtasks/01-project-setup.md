# Project Structure and Development Environment Setup

## Task Description
Set up the project structure and development environment for the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Virtual Environment
- Created a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) for isolated dependency management

### 2. Poetry Configuration
- Set up Poetry for dependency management
- Created `pyproject.toml` with all required dependencies:
  - PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF processing
  - Ollama client for LLM integration
  - PyQt6 for the UI
  - ChromaDB for vector storage
  - Development tools (pytest, black, isort, flake8)

### 3. Project Structure
Created a modular project structure following the architecture document:
```
stmt_obfuscator/
├── ui/                  # User interface components
├── pdf_parser/          # PDF parsing and text extraction
├── pii_detection/       # PII detection using Ollama
├── rag/                 # RAG context enhancement
├── pii_management/      # PII entity management
├── obfuscation/         # PDF obfuscation
└── output_generator/    # Output generation
```

### 4. Core Components
Implemented initial versions of key modules:
- `main.py`: Application entry point
- `config.py`: Configuration settings
- `ui/main_window.py`: Basic UI with PyQt6
- `pdf_parser/parser.py`: PDF parsing with PyMuPDF
- `pii_detection/detector.py`: PII detection with Ollama
- `rag/context_enhancer.py`: RAG implementation with ChromaDB
- `pii_management/manager.py`: PII entity management

### 5. Testing Framework
- Set up pytest for testing
- Created test directory structure mirroring the main package
- Implemented initial tests for PDF parser and PII detector
- Added test fixtures and configuration in `conftest.py`

### 6. Code Quality Tools
- Configured pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Set up black, isort, and flake8 for code formatting and linting
- Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with appropriate settings

### 7. Development Scripts
- Created `scripts/setup_dev_env.sh` to automate environment setup
- Made the script executable for easy use

## Outcome
The project structure and development environment have been successfully set up, providing a solid foundation for implementing the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator according to the architecture document and findings from the proof-of-concept.

## Commit
The changes were committed with the message: "Initial project setup and environment configuration"
