# Obfuscation Module Implementation

## Task Description
Implement an obfuscation module that applies pattern-preserving masking to detected PII, handles different entity types appropriately, maintains consistency across the document, preserves document layout and structure, and includes integrity checks to validate transaction totals.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Pattern-Preserving Masking
- Implemented entity type-specific obfuscation techniques:
  - **Account numbers:** Keep last 4 digits (e.g., "1234-5678-9012-3456" → "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-3456")
  - **Phone numbers:** Maintain formatting (e.g., "(555) 123-4567" → "(XXX) XXX-XXXX")
  - **Email addresses:** Preserve structure (e.g., "john.doe@example.com" → "jXXXXXXX@XXXXXX.XXX")
  - **Names:** Replace with consistent placeholders while preserving capitalization
  - **Addresses:** Replace components while maintaining structure
- Preserved format, length, and visual appearance of original text
- Ensured readability and utility of the obfuscated document

### 2. Entity Type-Specific Handling
- Implemented specialized handlers for 12 different entity types:
  - PERSON_NAME
  - ADDRESS
  - ACCOUNT_NUMBER
  - ROUTING_NUMBER
  - PHONE_NUMBER
  - EMAIL
  - ORGANIZATION_NAME
  - CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER
  - SSN
  - DATE_OF_BIRTH
  - IP_ADDRESS
  - URL
- Each handler applies appropriate masking rules based on entity type
- Configurable masking strategies per entity type

### 3. Consistency Management
- Implemented entity normalization and grouping:
  - Normalize entity text for comparison (case, whitespace, punctuation)
  - Group similar entities based on normalized text
  - Apply consistent replacement across all instances
- Created a mapping system to track and reuse replacements
- Ensured that the same entity is obfuscated the same way throughout the document

### 4. Document Layout Preservation
- Maintained original document structure:
  - Preserved whitespace and formatting
  - Replaced text in-place without changing length
  - Maintained alignment in tables and columns
  - Preserved font styles and sizes
- Implemented specialized handling for tables and text blocks
- Ensured that obfuscated document maintains visual similarity to original

### 5. Financial Integrity Checks
- Implemented transaction validation:
  - Extract beginning and ending balances
  - Identify transaction tables
  - Extract transaction amounts and running balances
  - Verify that financial data is preserved after obfuscation
- Added checksums to validate that transaction totals remain unchanged
- Implemented warning system for potential financial data corruption

### 6. Integration with Other Modules
- Designed interfaces for seamless integration:
  - Takes input from PII detection module
  - Works with PDF parser's document structure
  - Prepares document for output generator
- Implemented a pipeline architecture for smooth data flow
- Added hooks for manual review and correction

### 7. Performance and Scalability
- Optimized for large documents:
  - Efficient in-place replacement algorithms
  - Parallel processing where applicable
  - Memory-efficient operations
- Added progress tracking and reporting
- Implemented batch processing capabilities

## Files Created/Modified
1. `stmt_obfuscator/obfuscation/obfuscator.py` - Main obfuscation module implementation
2. `stmt_obfuscator/obfuscation/__init__.py` - Updated to expose the Obfuscator class
3. `tests/obfuscation/test_obfuscator.py` - Comprehensive test suite
4. `tests/obfuscation/__init__.py` - Updated for test package
5. `examples/obfuscation_example.py` - Example script demonstrating usage
6. `stmt_obfuscator/obfuscation/README.md` - Documentation for the module

## Outcome
The obfuscation module successfully implements pattern-preserving masking for different PII entity types while maintaining document layout and financial data integrity. The module is well-tested, documented, and ready for integration with other components of the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator.

## Commit
