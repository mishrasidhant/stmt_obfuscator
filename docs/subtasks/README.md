   - Created diverse synthetic bank statement samples
   - Implemented unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
   - Developed performance benchmarking system
   - Validated PII detection across different statement types
   - Ensured transaction integrity after obfuscation

## Next Steps

The project has completed all planned subtasks. For a comprehensive overview of the current project status and future plans, see the [Project Status](../project_status.md) document.

Future enhancements may include:

1. Advanced Features
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Support for additional document formats
   - Enhanced RAG with more specialized financial knowledge
   - Improved visualization of detected PII

2. Performance Optimizations
   - Further optimize processing speed for large documents
   - Reduce memory footprint
   - Explore alternative models for improved accuracy/speed tradeoffs

## Source Control Practices

Each subtask is committed to the repository with a descriptive commit message upon completion. This ensures good source control practices and makes it easy to track progress and changes.
