   - Created modular architecture following the design document

2. [Enhanced PII Detection Module Design](02-pii-detection-module-design.md)
   - Designed two-stage detection approach
   - Created type-specific prompts and post-processing rules
   - Implemented confidence thresholds and Ollama integration

3. [PDF Parsing Module Implementation](03-pdf-parsing-module.md)
   - Implemented PDF structure validation
   - Extracted text with positional metadata
   - Identified tables and financial data sections
   - Created structured document object with layout coordinates

4. [RAG Module Design](04-rag-module-design.md)
   - Designed targeted RAG for ambiguous cases
   - Created bank-specific pattern prioritization
   - Incorporated document context
   - Implemented ChromaDB integration

5. [Obfuscation Module Implementation](05-obfuscation-module.md)
   - Implemented pattern-preserving masking
   - Created entity type-specific handling
   - Maintained consistency across documents
   - Preserved document layout and structure
   - Added financial integrity checks

6. [Project Setup Verification and Fixes](06-project-setup-verification.md)
   - Verified all components working correctly

   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Ensured all tests passing

## Next Steps

The next planned subtasks are:

1. User Interface Implementation
   - Create file selection dialog
   - Implement processing progress bar
   - Develop PII review interface with confidence visualization
   - Add manual correction capabilities
   - Create output preview pane

2. Comprehensive Testing Framework
   - Create diverse synthetic bank statement samples
   - Test PII detection across different statement types
   - Evaluate performance for different PII types
   - Benchmark multiple Ollama models
   - Validate transaction integrity after obfuscation

## Source Control Practices

Each subtask is committed to the repository with a descriptive commit message upon completion. This ensures good source control practices and makes it easy to track progress and changes.
