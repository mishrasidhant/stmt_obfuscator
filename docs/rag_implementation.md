# RAG Implementation in PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator

## Overview

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module in the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator enhances PII detection by providing contextual information for ambiguous cases. This document summarizes the current implementation, integration with other components, and recommendations for future improvements.

## Current State

The RAG implementation is **partially complete** with the following components implemented:

- Core `RAGContextEnhancer` class in `stmt_obfuscator/rag/context_enhancer.py`
- ChromaDB integration for vector storage and retrieval
- Knowledge base initialization with common PII patterns
- Context retrieval mechanism for enhancing PII detection
- Optional activation through configuration settings

The implementation follows the design outlined in the [RAG Module Design](subtasks/04-rag-module-design.md) document, focusing on:

1. Selective activation for ambiguous cases
2. Bank-specific pattern prioritization
3. Document context incorporation
4. Efficient retrieval using ChromaDB

## Integration with PII Detection System

The RAG module integrates with the PII detection system through the following mechanism:

1. The `PIIDetector.detect_pii()` method accepts an optional `rag_context` parameter
2. When PII detection encounters ambiguous text, it can request context from the RAG module
3. The `RAGContextEnhancer.get_context()` method retrieves relevant patterns and examples
4. The PII detector incorporates this context into its prompt for improved detection
5. The enhanced prompt leads to more accurate PII identification

Code integration points:

```python
# In PIIDetector.detect_pii()
prompt = self._create_prompt(text, rag_context)

# In PIIDetector._create_prompt()
if rag_context:
    prompt += "\n\nAdditional context for detection:\n"
    for key, value in rag_context.items():
        prompt += f"{key}: {value}\n"
```

## Knowledge Base Content

The RAG module's knowledge base contains:

1. **Account number patterns** - Common formats for bank account numbers
2. **Routing number patterns** - Standard formats for routing numbers
3. **Name patterns** - Common name formats in financial documents
4. **Address patterns** - Address formats typically found in bank statements
5. **Phone number patterns** - Various phone number formats
6. **Email patterns** - Email address formats
7. **Bank name patterns** - Common financial institution names

Each pattern is stored with metadata including:
- Pattern type (e.g., ACCOUNT_NUMBER, PERSON_NAME)
- Example text for reference

## Performance Considerations

The RAG implementation includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Selective Activation** - RAG is only triggered for ambiguous cases, not all text
2. **Configurable Enabling** - Can be disabled via `RAG_ENABLED` setting in `config.py`
3. **Efficient Storage** - Uses ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval
4. **Persistence** - Stores embeddings on disk to avoid recomputation

No formal performance metrics have been collected for the RAG implementation, which represents a gap in the current evaluation.

## Testing Status

The RAG implementation currently lacks dedicated test coverage:

- No unit tests specifically for the `RAGContextEnhancer` class
- No integration tests for the interaction between RAG and PII detection
- No performance benchmarks for RAG operations

This represents a significant gap in the testing framework that should be addressed.

## Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the current implementation, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Implement unit tests for the `RAGContextEnhancer` class
   - Create integration tests for RAG and PII detection interaction
   - Develop performance benchmarks for RAG operations

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for frequently retrieved contexts
   - Optimize embedding generation for faster retrieval
   - Add batch processing capabilities for multiple queries

3. **Knowledge Base Enhancement**
   - Expand the knowledge base with more bank-specific patterns
   - Add more examples for each pattern type
   - Implement a feedback mechanism to improve patterns over time

4. **Integration Improvements**
   - Develop more sophisticated criteria for when to trigger RAG
   - Improve context incorporation into PII detection prompts
   - Add confidence scoring based on RAG context quality

5. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation for the RAG module
   - Add usage examples for different scenarios
   - Document performance characteristics and resource requirements

## Conclusion

The RAG implementation provides a solid foundation for enhancing PII detection in the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator. While the core functionality is in place, there are opportunities for improvement in testing, performance optimization, and knowledge base enhancement. Addressing these recommendations would significantly strengthen this component of the system.
