# Docstring Style Guide for PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator

This document defines the standard docstring format for the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator project. Following a consistent docstring style improves code readability, makes documentation generation more effective, and helps new contributors understand the codebase more quickly.

## Google Style Docstrings

This project uses **Google style** docstrings. This style was chosen for its readability, widespread adoption, and excellent support in documentation generation tools like Sphinx.

## Format Guidelines

### Module Docstrings

Each module should have a docstring at the top of the file that describes the purpose of the module:

```python
"""
Module name and short description.

A more detailed description of what the module does and its role in the project.
Any important notes about usage or dependencies can be included here.
"""
```

### Class Docstrings

Class docstrings should describe the purpose of the class and any important behavior:

```python
class MyClass:
    """Short description of the class.
    
    A more detailed description of what the class does, its behavior,
    and its role in the project. Any important notes about usage can be included here.
    
    Attributes:
        attr_name (type): Description of the attribute.
        another_attr (type): Description of another attribute.
    """
```

### Method and Function Docstrings

Method and function docstrings should describe what the function does, its parameters, return values, and any exceptions it might raise:

```python
def my_function(param1, param2, optional_param=None):
    """Short description of what the function does.
    
    A more detailed description of the function's behavior, algorithm,
    or any other important information.
    
    Args:
        param1 (type): Description of param1.
        param2 (type): Description of param2.
        optional_param (type, optional): Description of optional_param. Defaults to None.
    
    Returns:
        type: Description of the return value.
        
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When and why this exception is raised.
    """
```

### Property Docstrings

Properties should be documented with a docstring that describes what the property represents:

```python
@property
def my_property(self):
    """Short description of what the property represents.
    
    Returns:
        type: Description of the return value.
    """
```

## Examples

### Module Example

```python
"""
PII Detection module for the PDF Bank Statement Obfuscator.

This module handles the detection of personally identifiable information (PII)
in bank statement text using local LLMs via Ollama. It provides functionality
to identify various types of PII such as names, addresses, account numbers, etc.
"""
```

### Class Example

```python
class PIIDetector:
    """PII detection engine for identifying sensitive information in text.
    
    This class uses a local LLM through Ollama to identify personally identifiable
    information in bank statement text. It can be enhanced with RAG context for
    improved detection accuracy.
    
    Attributes:
        model (str): The name of the Ollama model to use.
        host (str): The URL of the Ollama API host.
        confidence_threshold (float): Minimum confidence level for PII detection.
    """
```

### Method Example

```python
def detect_pii(self, text, rag_context=None):
    """Detect PII in the given text using Ollama.
    
    This method sends the text to a local LLM through Ollama to identify
    personally identifiable information. It can use RAG context to enhance
    detection accuracy for ambiguous cases.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The text to analyze for PII.
        rag_context (dict, optional): Additional context from RAG to enhance detection.
            Defaults to None.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the detected PII entities with their types,
            positions, and confidence scores.
    
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If unable to connect to the Ollama service.
    """
```

## Additional Guidelines

1. **Be Concise**: Keep descriptions clear and to the point.
2. **Use Complete Sentences**: Start with a capital letter and end with a period.
3. **Use Imperative Mood**: Describe functions as commands (e.g., "Get the value" not "Gets the value").
4. **Document Parameters Completely**: All parameters should be documented with their types and descriptions.
5. **Document Return Values**: Always document what a function returns, including the type.
6. **Document Exceptions**: If a function can raise exceptions, document when and why.
7. **Keep Formatting Consistent**: Follow the same indentation and spacing throughout.

## Tools and Enforcement

- **Sphinx**: Used for generating documentation from docstrings.
- **pydocstyle**: Can be used to check docstring style compliance.
- **pre-commit hooks**: Enforce docstring style checks before commits.
